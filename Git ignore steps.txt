Steps for ignoring files in Git:

1 - Open the local repository and start Git Bash over there.
2 - Execute the command: touch .gitignore
3 - Now open the '.gitignore' file in Notepad by: 'notepad .gitignore'
4 - Specify files and folders that are not to be tracked.
	Data can be entered in the following ways:
	 - <filename>.<extension> - File with the particular filename and extension won't be tracked.
	 - *.<extension> - Any file with that particular extension will not be tracked.
	 - <FolderName>/ - All the files and folders inside that particular folder will be ignored.
	*enter the data in a list format.

*git rm --cached <Filename> - untracks the tracked file.
